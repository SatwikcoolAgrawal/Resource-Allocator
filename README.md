# Resource-Allocator
System where you are given a list of virtual machines, each with its requested CPU and memory resources, and a list of physical hosts with available CPU and memory resources. The System handles the resource allocation, i.e, to assign virtual machines to physical hosts in a way that maximises resource utilisation and maintains fairness.
